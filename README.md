Roll Dice
Name any game that needs a dice to play with. If you try to name every game, it will take you a while. They all share a common problem. It may just so happen that the dice gets lost, it's your dog's new favourite toy, or a child chokes with it. This project solves each one of above mentioned problems, while proudly creating, on an entirely perfect code, a small inconvenience relating to access. You may need to have an electronic device at all times to be able to play. In today's society however, this is not an issue. 


So I wish you the best of luck playing!
